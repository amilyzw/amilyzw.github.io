														A girl was awoken by a soft glowing light. She opened her eyes to a tall blonde woman in a long white dress standing over her.
														"Where am I?" asked the girl, blinking away a heavy sleep. "It seems that you have dreamt too deep and have awoken where all thoughts originate."
														replied the woman. The girl slowly turned her head, finding that she was in a small, light peach cube that was completely empty save for the
														blonde woman and the big, softly pulsating, artificial moon that had awoken her. The moon encompassed almost the entirety of the room, gently rotating
														and was an oddly comforting sight to the girl. "Well, how do I get back to where I came from?" the girl asked, getting to her feet. The woman walked over to the front of
														the moon, extending a single finger toward it. "Follow the path," she said, tapping gently against a shallow crater. Suddenly, one of
														the walls opened to reveal the top of a large, golden ginkgo tree. After a soft nod from the woman, the girl cautiously walked over to the ginkgo and
														began descending. After many hours of climbing, her arms began to ache and she could go no longer. Spying a nook amongst the branches, the girl
														pulled herself down with a breath of relief. Just then, she heard a rustling behind her left shoulder and with a startled turn, found a young man
														with glasses the same shade of gold as the ginkgo leaves staring back at her. "You must be the lost traveler," he said, stepping out from the foliage.
														"Yes, do you know where this is?" asked the girl. "This is the memory tree, where the most significant events from people's lives are stored," he replied,
														handing her a ginkgo leaf. The girl took the leaf and tilted it in the light, suddenly noticing the faint images playing like film against the gold.
														She stood, mesmerized as some of the happiest memories she had ever had played back on the little leaf. Her trance was broken by a soft cough from
														the young man. "Be careful not to watch too closely or you'll never leave," he warned. The girl nodded, tucking the ginkgo leaf into her pocket. The
														young man pointed behind her, and she turned to see a small tree house nestled amongst the branches. "You'll find someone who can help you there," he
														said before turning around and disappearing up the trunk. The girl arduously made her way to the treehouse, and as she approached the door it swung open
														to reveal a child putting a handful of flowers in a vase next to a white bed. The child looked up as the girl entered and the door shut behind, setting
														down the delicate vase. "Hello there," said the child. "Hello. May I ask who you are?" said the girl. "I tend to emotions and keep them contained in my
														vases," said the child, gesturing around the treehouse. The girl noticed the abundance of flowers in vases, an explosion of different colors. "The vases that are
														yours are rather fragile, I have to be careful that they don't break and get out of control," mused the child. The girl chuckled, "My apologies
														for that." The child just smiled and took a seat on the bed, looking back at the white flowers. "You still have a long way to go before you can leave
														this world," the child said. "Is the journey hard?" asked the girl. "That depends on you," the child said simply. After a moment of silence, the child stood and opened the backdoor of the treehouse to reveal that they were now at the base of a giant
														blue dam. "Go straight!" yelled the child over the thundering of the water pouring down the dam. The girl stepped out and turned back, only to find
														that the tree and treehouse had disappeared, leaving only a vast expanse of concrete toward the dam. The girl began the long walk toward the dam.
													</p>
													<p>
														The girl walked for what seemed like endless amounts of time before spotting three figures in the distance. As she approached them, the roar of the water
														mysteriously subsided. She came up to three fashionably dressed young women standing in front of a door at the foot of the dam. The one on the left was the first
														to speak. "We've been waiting for you to see if you are worthy of passing through the gate," she said, putting her hand on her chin in skepticism. "How do I prove my worth?"
														inquired the girl. "You must pass all of our tests first," said the one in the middle. "We have to make sure you are ready to face what is beyond the dam," said the one on the right.
														The girl gazed upon the towering dam, accepting that she had no other way of progressing without the help of the keepers of the gate. The young woman on the left stepped forward.
														"For the first test, take this knife and cut through this rock," she said, pressing a small silver blade into the girl's hand and pointing toward a smooth boulder five times
														the size of the girl's head on the ground nearby. The girl was taken aback, for surely this was impossible. However, the young women simply stood waiting, and seeing
														that they were serious, the girl reluctantly approached the rock. After feelings for cracks or weaknesses and finding none, she started to saw away. She hacked and
														hawed and chipped and banged for hours on the rock with no progress. Eventually, the small silver knife was worn down to the handle. The girl looked up with dejection,
														frustrated she could not even pass the first test. However, the young woman on the left smiled and gave her a nod of approval. "I am the Guardian of Determination. For this
														test, it matters not if you break the rock, but if you have the will to never give up even when it seems impossible." The girl finally started to understand. "Thank you," she
														said with relief. The young woman in the middle stepped forward. "This test should hopefully be much shorter," she said with a laugh. "Answer me this: Walk on the living,
														they don't even mumble. Walk on the dead, the mutter and grumble. What are they?" she asked. The girl paused and thought for a moment. Then she suddenly recalled the earlier
														leg of her journey, and how the ginkgo tree had shed dried fronds on the branches stepping down. "They are leaves," answered the girl. "Correct. I am the Guardian of Knowledge.
														It's important to have a sharp mind when you return to your world," said the young woman. Finally, the one on the right stepped forward. "The final test is also simple. Here, I have a needle
														and a thread. Get the needle through the thread without touching the needle and thread at the same time. You may ask for additional materials." The girl thought for a long time
														pondering a solution. Finally, she remembered an old story about a similar situation. "May I have an ant and some honey?" she asked. An ant and a jar of honey were produced.
														After carefully tying the thread to the leg of the ant, the girl put a drop of honey on the ground and held the needle between honey and ant, forcing the ant to cross through the
														hole of the needle and threading it to get to honey. "Good job. I am the Guardian of Creativity. You have passed my test and have proven you are ready to go on to the next step
														of your journey," said the young woman on the right. The gate behind them swung open, revealing a dark tunnel through the dam. Each of the young women wished her luck, and with
														a deep breath, the girl ducked into the tunnel.
													 </p>
													 <p>
														 After a brief walk through the pitch black tunnel, the girl began to hear the trickle of water, followed by a faint light. Running towards the light, she arrived at the end of the tunnel
														 into a lush forest. Spotting a river nearby, she began to follow it. Soon she arrived at a bridge, and on the edge of the bridge were three teenage girls in white dresses gazing
														 into the water. They looked almost identical. They lifted their heads at the sound of the girl approaching. "May I pass through this bridge?" asked the girl. The triplets looked at each other.
														 "You may do anything you like, but come look into the water with us first," they said. The girl joined them at the edge of the bridge and looked into the water. To her surprise, she could
														 see shadowy figures at the bottom, and she drew back in fear. "There is no need to be startled," the triplets said. "We are the Fates of Time: Past, Present, and Future. Before you proceed,
														 you should observe this river with us. Come see what your future holds and decide if you still wish to leave this world." The girl turned her gaze back to the rippling water.
														 The shadowy figures began to take form, playing out all the sorrow and joy that would be hers. She stood at the water for a very long time, until at last her future ended as all human futures
														 do. The images dissipated back into the depths, leaving her alone in the present again. "What is your decision, now that you have seen what awaits you when you leave?" asked the triplets.
														 The girl wiped away the tears that had fallen without her even noticing. "Life must go on," she said simply, crossing the bridge and leaving the triplets to return to gazing into the river.
														 She continued through the woods until eventually the trees started to give way to an enchanting golden-green forest of bamboo. The girl sat down, feeling tired from her long journey. She felt
														 someone sit next to her and turned to see a lady draped in a long white cloth sit next to her. "And who might you be?" the girl asked wearily, tired of all the strange beings she had met today.
														 The lady said nothing, just looked at the girl with patience. A light breeze drifted through the bamboo, and the gentle rustling of the bamboo poles calmed the girl a little. Finally, the lady spoke: "I am the Fay of Longevity.
														 Just as bamboo is strong yet flexible, I have endured eternity with resilience." The girl considered her words. "Eternity is such an endlessly long time, I cannot even comprehend it," said the girl. "In time,
														 you will," replied the lady. "I am afraid for when that time comes," confessed the girl. "Afraid or not, it will come," answered the lady. A wave of acceptance washed over the girl, accompanied by
														 a feeling of relief. The girl sensed that she was near the end of her journey here. The lady pointed to a path through the bamboo. "There is just one more person to meet now," she said. The girl rose to
														 her feet and set off. She walked and walked with all fatigue having disappeared until the path opened to a beautiful open clearing with butterflies flitting about in the air. In the center of the
														 clearing sat someone. The girl approached the person, and when they turned around, the girl saw that the person was herself. "You finally made it," said the girl in the clearing. "Are you ready
														 to go back?" The two looked at each other for a long time. "I have always been ready," said the girl with a soft smile. She began to feel her eyelids grow heavy, and an overpowering drowsiness overtook
														 her. She surrendered to it, slowly sinking down.

													 A girl was awoken by a soft glowing light. She opened her eyes to a familiar computer screen, slumped over her desk. She sat up and looked out the window, and the moon was high in the sky, no longer reachable
													 with the tip of a finger. She shook herself awake, stretched, and stood up, leaving her desk for her proper bed. As she stood, a single golden ginkgo leaf fell from her pocket.
